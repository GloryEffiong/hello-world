I'm Glory (again).
I'm a content writer and communications specialist.
I'm currently learning Python, HTML and JavaScript as pathways in my tech journey.
I'm interested in blockchain, cryptocurrencies, web-3 and self training to be a better technical writer in these niches. 
I'm a regular 9-5er who is open to new opportunities and constant learning.
I have facilitated a few events (flexing my PR specialist muscles).
Sometimes, I get described as an eagle-eyed editor and proofreader.
My pronouns are she/her.
I'm open to collaborations and mentorship.
